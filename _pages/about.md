# Bio

I am a Master's student in Economics at the Universidad de San Andr√©s [(UdeSA)](https://udesa.edu.ar/departamento-de-economia/maestria-en-economia) and a pre-doctoral assistant at the same institution. My primary research interests lie in international economics, applied econometrics, and economic development, with a focus on the application of machine learning techniques to economic analysis. You can find my Master's thesis [here](http://francoriottini.github.io/files/Riottini%20Depetris%20(2024).pdf).

Currently, I am working as a consultant for international organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Previously, I was an Economic Analyst at the Center for Studies of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce (BCSF), where I conducted macro and microeconomic analyses focusing on regional economic activity.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the Universidad Nacional del Litoral [(UNL)](https://www.fce.unl.edu.ar/), where I completed a thesis on the Argentine agro-industrial sector, its exports, and comparative advantages in trade with the European Union.

Since 2024, I have been teaching an introductory economics course, which you can explore [here](https://github.com/francoriottini/EcoIUdeSA).

My research aims to integrate traditional econometric methods with advanced artificial intelligence techniques to address complex economic challenges and contribute to evidence-based policy development.
