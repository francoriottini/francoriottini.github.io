Economist from the Universidad [Nacional del Litoral (UNL)](https://www.fce.unl.edu.ar/) in Santa Fe, Argentina. Currently pursuing a Master's degree at the  [Universidad de San Andres (UdeSA)](https://udesa.edu.ar/departamento-de-economia/maestria-en-economia). I completed my undergraduate studies with an applied study on the agro-industrial sector in Argentina, its exports and its comparative advantages in trade with the European Union between 2004 and 2019.

From 2019 to 2022 I worked at the [Center for Studies of the Santa Feâ€™s Chamber of Commerce (BCSF)](https://www.bcsf.com.ar/ces/index.php), where I conducted macro and microeconomic analyses with a focus on the economic activity of the province.

Since 2023 I have been working as a pre-doctoral assistant at UdeSA and as a consultant for international organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Since 2024 I have been teaching an introductory economics. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/francoriottini/EcoIUdeSA)!

My research interests are in development economics, international economics and economic history. I'm also interested in the application of machine learning and large language models to economics.
