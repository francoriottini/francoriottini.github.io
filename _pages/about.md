Economist from the Universidad [Nacional del Litoral (UNL)](https://www.fce.unl.edu.ar/) in Santa Fe, Argentina. Currently, I'm doing a Master at [Universidad de San Andres (UdeSA)](https://udesa.edu.ar/departamento-de-economia/maestria-en-economia).

I completed my undergraduate studies with an applied study on the agro-industrial sector in Argentina, its exports and its comparative advantages in trade with the European Union between 2004 and 2019.

From 2019 to 2022 I've been working at the [Center for Studies of the Santa Feâ€™s Chamber of Commerce (BCSF)](https://www.bcsf.com.ar/ces/index.php), where I carried out macro and microeconomic analysis with a focus on the economic activity of the province.

I've also been a teaching assistant in several subjects, including introductory subjects and also macroeconomics. Currently, I am teaching assistant of History of Economic Thought at UdeSA 

My research interests are in development economics, international economics and economical history.
