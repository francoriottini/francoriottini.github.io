I hold a Master's degree in Economics from the Universidad de San Andrés (UdeSA), where I previously worked as a pre-doctoral assistant. I started my PhD in Economics at the University of Michigan in August 2025. My primary research interests lie in international economics, firm dynamics and productivity, and education, with a focus on the application of machine learning techniques to economic analysis. You can find my Master's thesis [here](http://francoriottini.github.io/files/Riottini%20Depetris%20(2024).pdf) (which received the Best Master Thesis Award 2024 from UdeSA!).

Previously, I worked as a consultant for international organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. I was also an Economic Analyst at the Center for Studies of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce (BCSF), where I conducted macro and microeconomic analyses focusing on regional economic activity.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the Universidad Nacional del Litoral [(UNL)](https://www.fce.unl.edu.ar/), where I completed a thesis on the Argentine agro-industrial sector, its exports, and comparative advantages in trade with the European Union.

I previously taught an introductory economics course; the materials remain available [here](https://github.com/francoriottini/EcoIUdeSA).
